## Abstract

This work introduces **THRML‑SON‑QTTN**, a *hybrid computational paradigm* that fuses **Stochastic Oscillator Networks (SON)** with **Quantum‑inspired Tree Tensor Networks (QTTN)** to achieve scalable, physically interpretable probabilistic inference.  
The model integrates oscillator‑based Gaussian sampling, thermodynamic energy feedback, and hierarchical tensor decomposition to enable continuous‑discrete hybrid reasoning across structured dynamical systems.

## 1. SON–RLC Analogies

The **Stochastic Oscillator Network (SON)** models each node as a damped, coupled RLC oscillator whose voltage state represents a Gaussian random variable.  
The local temporal evolution follows:

\[
V_i(t+\Delta t) = V_i(t) + \Delta t \left( \sum_j K_{ij}(V_j - V_i) - \omega_i^2 V_i + \eta_i(t) \right)
\]

where \(K_{ij}\) denotes coupling strength, \(\omega_i\) is the intrinsic frequency, and \(\eta_i(t)\) represents stochastic thermal noise.

The analogy operates on three principles:

1. **Capacitive integration → mean aggregation**  
   The capacitor voltage corresponds to the local expectation of the neighboring Gaussian states.

2. **Inductive feedback → variance propagation**  
   Inductive phase delay naturally encodes correlations across oscillators, mimicking covariance transport.

3. **Resistive damping → energy normalization**  
   Resistance introduces gradient‑like descent toward energy minima, maintaining numerical and probabilistic stability.

The end result is a *continuous‑time stochastic sampler* governed by the same equilibrium statistics as a harmonic Gaussian energy model—analogous to Langevin diffusion but parameterized by circuit dynamics.

## 2. Probabilistic Gaussian Nodes and TT‑SVD Decomposition

Each SON node yields a Gaussian latent component parameterized by mean and variance.  
Aggregating these across structured graphs produces a high‑order tensor \( \mathcal{X} \) representing joint system states.

The **Quantum‑inspired Tree Tensor Network (QTTN)** decomposes \( \mathcal{X} \) using **Tensor‑Train Singular Value Decomposition (TT‑SVD)**:

\[
\mathcal{X}(i_1, i_2, ..., i_N) \approx \prod_{k=1}^{N} G_k(i_k)
\]

with factors \(G_k\) of bounded TT‑rank \(r_k\).  
Each singular value spectrum \(S_k\) provides a measure of local information density, defining an implicit *energy spectrum hierarchy* within the system.

The bridge between **probabilistic Gaussian nodes** and **TT‑SVD** lies in the following correspondences:

| Concept | SON Term | QTTN Equivalent |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Local mean/variance | Node voltage amplitude / phase | Local tensor block |
| Neighbor coupling | RLC conductance links | Tensor edge contraction |
| Global joint distribution | Oscillator array ensemble | Full tensor state |
| Marginal extraction | Averaging across nodes | Tensor partial contraction |
| Noise regularization | Thermal fluctuation | Rank truncation / singular cutoff |

Thus, SON acts as a *continuous sampler* providing smooth, physics‑grounded state evolution; QTTN translates these continuous dynamics into a *compressed, discrete tensor form* suitable for inference, contraction, and hierarchical reasoning.
